Hello! Let me introduce my project, NeonRunner
===

This is an almost ordinary indi-game with lvl-generation

---
#### Level generation
 - `#` - block(non-custom)
 - ` `(space) - empty space(where hero can travel)
 - `H` - position, where hero staing
 - `X` - end-level position

When you've **already** wrote your lvl, paste it to pastebin(in non-private mode)

---
#### Thanks you :)
