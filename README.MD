Hello! Let me introduce my project, NeonRunner
===

This is an almost ordinary indi-game with lvl-generation

---
#### Level generation
 - `#` - block(non-custom)
 - `.` - empty space(where hero can travel)
 - `H` - position, where hero staing
 - `X` - end-level position
 - `|` - levels separation(should be in the end of file)
 - `J` - high-jump block(speeds up and larges the height of your jump)

When you've **already** wrote your lvl, paste it to pastebin(in non-private mode)
Then cope url of ur pastebin(last numbers of the url) and paste it to the main input view. Just press "Start level" and enjoy your game!
Level example:
```
H........X
....####.#
...#......
.....X...
#J########
|
```

Paste example: `https://pastebin.com/5fnUb9gn`
What you should copy from this paste: `5fnUb9gn`
