Hello! Let me introduce my project, NeonRunner
===

This is an almost ordinary indi-game with lvl-generation

---
#### Level generation
 - `#` - block(non-custom)
 - `.` - empty space(where hero can travel)
 - `H` - position, where hero staing
 - `X` - end-level position
 - '|' - levels separation(should be in the end of file)
 - 'J' - high-jump block(speeds up and larges the height of your jump)

When you've **already** wrote your lvl, paste it to pastebin(in non-private mode)

---
#### Thanks you :)
